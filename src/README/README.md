⚔️ Description

The Dungeon Game is a simple text-based adventure that demonstrates decision-making, loops, random events, and exception-free user interaction in Java.

The player explores 5 mysterious rooms, each containing a random event — a deadly trap, a healing potion, or a monster battle!
The goal is simple: survive all 5 rooms with your health above zero.

🎯 Objectives

Start with 100 health points.

Explore 5 rooms in sequence.

In each room, a random event (1–3) occurs:

1: Trap → Lose 20 health.

2: Healing Potion → Gain 15 health (max 100).

3: Monster Encounter → Guess the monster’s weak spot (1–5).

If health drops to 0 or below, the game ends immediately.

If the player survives all 5 rooms, they win the game.

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

For Loops → To iterate through rooms.

Switch Statement → To handle random room events.

do-while Loop → For guessing until the correct number is found.

Random Class → To generate random events and monster numbers.

Scanner → To handle user input.

Conditional Logic → To manage health limits and victory/defeat conditions.
